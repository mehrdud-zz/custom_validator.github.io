Project: Segregate OneClick
Tasks: 
•	Segregate DB
•	Remove dependency on EPACS database
•	Dedicated notification mechanism (setup a notification manager for OneClick)
•	Merchant auto-boarding for WPAP 
•	Let’s rebrand!

Deliverable: WPAP GPPs as a standalone product with no hard dependency on WPAP products (except for infrastructure, development needs, design, support !!!  )

Business ask/value: 
•	Ground work necessary for other phases

Project: GPP Framework
Tasks: 
•	Migrate PaymentMethodAPI to .Net Core
•	Extend PaymentMethodAPI to cover GPP metadata
•	Extend PaymentMethodAPI for request marshalling to integration endpoints
•	FXBooking implementation: using WPAP functionality for now… this will move into FXaaS phase 2
•	Consumer and merchant configuration implementation (FXaaS pattern) 
•	Utilise OpenShift and SOP infrastructure 

Deliverable: Gateway agnostic service to be used by Gateway 2.0 and all other internal consumers

Business ask/value: 
•	Stand-alone, gateway agnostic GPP integration platform
•	Gateway 2.0 can use GPPs (see above) 
•	Standardise Worldpay business logic across all APMs (e.g: same FX conversion policy, same token mechanism, same notification mechanism)
•	Opens the door to integrate with strategic merchant notification service

Project: Improve GPP Framework
Tasks:
•	Shared payment pages for all Worldpay
•	Integrate WPG standalone services
•	Use validator service in conjunction with PaymentMethodAPI for GPP API request validation
•	GPP Token generation service (reuse current functionality)
•	Turn GPP API to backend only feature

Deliverable: faster and easier GPP integration, capacity planning for the future

Business ask/value:
•	Same backend + shared front end= reduce cost + reduce time-to-market for GPP integrations

Project: Generic GPP Integration
Tasks:
•	Define generic user journey/transaction flow
•	Basic implementation
•	Extend to cover configurable settings

Deliverable: Integration product/set of APIs for interested GPPs to integrate with Worldpay (heavy caveats in that statement)

Business ask/value:
•	Generic GPP integration so GPPs can integrate with Worldpay (!?) as long as we can get them to do it!

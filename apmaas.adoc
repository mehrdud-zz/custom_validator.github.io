== Introduction

Introduce project aims & objectives from requirements xref:ref-1[reference #1] etc ...

GPP integrations have been implemented in specific gateways and platforms causing service coverage issues for heritage Worldpay merchants. This project aims to present a unified integration interface to internal Worldpay platforms with the aim of providing a gateway agnostic system.


== Phases suggested
To achieve goals of GPPaaS, few phases are suggested in this document. An incremental approach to create GPPaaS would enable product and technology to re-evaluate direction of the overall project

=== Project: Segregate OneClick
To create a standalone 
Tasks: 
* Segregate DB
* Remove dependency on EPACS database
* Dedicated notification mechanism (setup a notification manager for OneClick)
* Merchant auto-boarding for WPAP 

Deliverable: WPAP GPPs as a standalone product with no hard dependency on WPAP products (except for infrastructure, development needs, design, support !!!  )

Business ask/value: 

* Ground work necessary for other phases

=== Project: GPP Framework
Tasks: 

* Migrate PaymentMethodAPI to .Net Core
* Extend PaymentMethodAPI to cover GPP metadata
* Extend PaymentMethodAPI for requ est marshalling to integration endpoints
* FXBooking implementation: using WPAP functionality for now… this will move into FXaaS phase 2
* Consumer and merchant configuration implementation (FXaaS pattern) 
* Utilise OpenShift and SOP infrastructure 

Deliverable: 

* Gateway agnostic service to be used by Gateway 2.0 and all other internal consumers

Business ask/value: 

* Stand-alone, gateway agnostic GPP integration platform
* Gateway 2.0 can use GPPs (see above) 
* Standardise Worldpay business logic across all GPPs (e.g: same FX conversion policy, same token mechanism, same notification mechanism)
* Opens the door to integrate with strategic merchant notification service

=== Project: Improve GPP Framework
Tasks:

* Shared payment pages for all Worldpay
* Integrate WPG standalone services
* Use validator service in conjunction with PaymentMethodAPI for GPP API request validation
* GPP Token generation service (reuse current functionality)
* Turn GPP API to backend only feature

Deliverables:

* faster and easier GPP integration, capacity planning for the future

Business ask/value:

* Same backend + shared front end= reduce cost + reduce time-to-market for GPP integrations

=== Project: Generic GPP Integration
Tasks:
* Define generic user journey/transaction flow
* Basic implementation
* Extend to cover configurable settings

Deliverable: 

* Integration product/set of APIs for interested GPPs to integrate with Worldpay (heavy caveats in that statement)

Business ask/value:

* Generic GPP integration so GPPs can integrate with Worldpay (!?) as long as we can get them to do it! 

== Functional View


=== Stateless-ish GPP integration
GPP integrations are predominantly asynchronous. This means that a truly stateless service design with significant implementation cost is unlikely. Current implementation of Merchant API and OneClick relies on merchant/domain structure of WPAP. To remove this reliance, the new GPP API will rely on the calling consumer to provide merchant necessary merchant and shopper details in the GPP call. This does not remove the dependency of on-boarding merchant into WPAP treasury system, however this step can be automated. More details in this section: (Mehrchant-onboarding)


=== Endpoint marshalling
All GPPs implemented in WPAP and standalone GPP integration services implemented by WPG can be included in this project. All GPP requests received by t

=== Transactions
In current WPAP implementation, a GPP transaction is tightly coupled with a money movement transaction. When an GPP transaction is completed, a money movement is immediately initiated. A cross platform capability would only deal with a GPP transaction and processes a transaction life cycle, notifying interested parties including back-end treasury mechanism of a transaction's status change. The responsibility of how to handle a transaction status notification is up to the consumer. In case of WPAP treasury mechanism, a GPP notification, would cause a money movement

Example of money movement in a notification subscriber:
 * Identify gateway specific merchant
 * move money from-to account with a reference to GPP transaction
 * mark internal transaction as complete


could initiate a transaction. 

=== Notifications
Notifications would be sent out on each transaction status change. 

[source,json]
{
   "GPPNotificaion":{
      "NotificaitonId":"33d7fe3c-5a2d-4c8e-83aa-18875baa5f1a",
      "TokenId":"33d7fe3c-5a2d-4c8e-83aa-18875baa5f1a",
      "TokenExpiryUtcTime":"33d7fe3c-5a2d-4c8e-83aa-18875baa5f1a",
      "GPPReference":"33d7fe3c-5a2d-4c8e-83aa-18875baa5f1a",
      "GPPTransactionStatus":"Paid",
      "GPPCode":"200",
      "GPPMessage":"",
      "ConsumerId":"WPG",
      "MerhcantId":"33d7fe3c-5a2d-4c8e-83aa-18875baa5f1a",
      "ShopperDetails":"Mehrdud Ulfsark",
      "FXBookingId":"33d7fe3c-5a2d-4c8e-83aa-18875baa5f1a",
      "SourceCurrency":"GBP",
      "TargetCurrency":"EUR",
      "Value":"12.23",
      "Country":"Netherlands",
      "CountryCode":"ND",
      "GPP":"iDeal"
   }
}
 
Notifications in short term can utilise a dedicated WPAP Notification Manager. In long term, notifications should align with a Worldpay's strategic solution


=== Merchant On-boarding
This is not a strict requirement of GPP API. If WPAP's existing treasury and settlement mechanism is used for GPP reconciliation as a short term tactical solution, then merchants need to be boarded in WPAP. This can be automated. 

In long term, Worldpay's strategic solution would assume this responsibility.


=== Foreign Exchange Conversions
The existing FXBooking functionality implemented in MerchantAPI calculates and guarantees FX value of a transaction. This functionality is different across WPAP and WPG. In a cross platform approach, GPP orchestrator should leverage FXaaS to get a guaranteed rate. In absence of such functionality, GPP API would rely on WPAP's FXaaS consumer settings and on WPAP treasury function to provide the guaranteed rate. 

=== Payment Pages
Long term target architecture is to remove gateway specific payment pages. To service existing platforms, payment pages service would need to submit merchant and consumer platform details to GPP API 

=== Validation
Use a standalone dedicated instance of WPAP new validation engine to validate requests on the point of entry

=== Country Currency Validation
Payment method API provides master data for GPPs. 

== Non-functional View

== Business Process View
=== Merchant On-boarding
Valid options:
* Manual BAU process
* Automated process: Provide an API for automated merchant on-boarding to provide minimum required information to board a merchant. Identify automatically on-boarded merchant as consumer platform's merchant inside WPAP treasury mechanism. 
* Gateway 2.0: Add WPAP treasury on-boarding step to WPG automated on-boarding step
* Alternatively use WPG existing merchant... BAD BAD BAD

=== Shopper Journey
==== Synchronous
Shopper presses checkout on merchant pages
Shopper fills up the payment page
Payment page submit a request to GPP API
GPP API identifies consumer platform
GPP API validates country currency combination
GPP API validates provided information for a request to target GPP against validation engine
GPP API requests FXBooking from WPAP... to be replaced with FXaaS Phase 2
GPP API submits the request to GPP integration endpoint 
GPP integration creates GPP token
GPP API returns URL+token from GPP integration
Shopper is redirected by payments pages to GPP redirectionURL 
Shopper completes the payment
Shopper is redirected to payment pages

==== Asynchronous 
OneClick Manager queries GPP token for pending tokens
On status change send a notification to listeners: consumer platform + WPAP treasury mechanism 
On status=paid/returned stop polling

* OneClick listener receives notification from GPP 
* OneClick listener saves received notification 
* OneClick Manager loops through received notifications, updates relevant token status
